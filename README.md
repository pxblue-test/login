# Login Example

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/pxblue/login/tree/reactnative.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/pxblue/login/tree/reactnative)

This is a sample application showing how to build a basic login workflow with authentication and route blocking.

## Running the example
To run this example, first clone the repository. Each of our example projects comes with a branch for each supported framework. You can choose which branch to use when you clone the repository (or you can switch after cloning as well):

```
git clone https://github.com/pxblue/login -b reactnative
```

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies (note: our projects are set up to be run with yarn):

```
cd login
yarn
```

You can then run the example through Expo by running:
```
yarn start
```

This will present you with several options for testing the application (such as using a local simulator or connected device). Using a local simulator is the simplest option and avoids the hassle of getting your computer and test device connected to the same network, configuring proxies, etc.
