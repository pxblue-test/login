# Login Example

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/pxblue/login/tree/ionic.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/pxblue/login/tree/ionic)

This is a sample application showing how to build a basic login page with authentication and route blocking.

## Running the example
To run this example, first clone the repository. Each of our example projects comes with a branch for Angular, React and a branch for Ionic. You can choose which branch to use when you clone the repository (or you can switch after cloning as well):

```
git clone https://github.com/pxblue/login -b ionic
```

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies (note: our projects are set up to be run with yarn):

```
cd login
yarn
```

You can then run the example on web browser :
```
ionic serve
```
If you want to run the example in simulator. Firstly you need to build the code and open the project in xcode and run simulator
```
ionic cordova build ios
ionic cordova build android
```
